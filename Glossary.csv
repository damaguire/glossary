"1","Analytics","Analytics has emerged as a catch-all term for a variety of different business intelligence (BI)- and application-related initiatives. For some, it is the process of analyzing information from a particular domain, such as website analytics. For others, it is applying the breadth of BI capabilities to a specific content area (for example, sales, service, supply chain and so on). In particular, BI vendors use the “analytics” moniker to differentiate their products from the competition. Increasingly, “analytics” is used to describe statistical and mathematical data analysis that clusters, segments, scores and predicts what scenarios are most likely to happen. Whatever the use cases, “analytics” has moved deeper into the business vernacular. Analytics has garnered a burgeoning interest from business and IT professionals looking to exploit huge mounds of internally generated and externally available data."

Its purpose is to execute IT access policies to structured/unstructured data, devices and services. Entitlement management can be delivered by different technologies, and is often different across platforms, applications, network components and devices."
"22","Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)","Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design paradigm in which a software component executes in response to receiving one or more event notifications. EDA is more loosely coupled than the client/server paradigm because the component that sends the notification doesn’t know the identity of the receiving components at the time of compiling."
"23","Federated Identity Management","Federated identity management enables identity information to be developed and shared among several entities and across trust domains. Tools and standards permit identity attributes to be transferred from one trusted identifying and authenticating entity to another for authentication, authorization and other purposes, thus providing “single sign-on” convenience and efficiencies to identified individuals, identity providers and relying parties."
"24","Federated Search","Federated search aggregates the results of a user-initiated search to multiple search engines and presents those results back to the user. Sometimes federated search interleaves the results, so that they are compared with each other; sometimes they are just presented next to each other as alternatives."
"25","Identity and Access Management (IAM)","Identity and access management (IAM) is the security discipline that enables the right individuals to access the right resources at the right times for the right reasons.

IAM addresses the mission-critical need to ensure appropriate access to resources across increasingly heterogeneous technology environments, and to meet increasingly rigorous compliance requirements. This security practice is a crucial undertaking for any enterprise. It is increasingly business-aligned, and it requires business skills, not just technical expertise.

Enterprises that develop mature IAM capabilities can reduce their identity management costs and, more importantly, become significantly more agile in supporting new business initiatives."
"26","Integration","Integration services are detailed design and implementation services that link application functionality (custom software or package software) and/or data with each other or with the established or planned IT infrastructure.

"36","Message Broker","A message broker is a logical hub that copies and resends messages to one or more destinations. As a value-adding third party between information sources and information consumers, it can complement a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Like an SOA, a broker is a design abstraction that may be implemented using component software for some or all of the connections. The interface from a message broker to the application may use an object request broker (ORB) or object transaction monitor (OTM); a request to the message broker may be implemented as a series of method calls to participating components."
"37","Message Queuing","The message-queuing or store-and-forward model is basically the message-passing model with one additional feature. Message queuing is asynchronous in a manner similar to a traditional postal system — i.e., the recipient need not be available when the message is sent. Message queuing stores messages at an intermediate node on the network in a queue and then forwards the messages to the intended targets."
"38","Messaging","Messaging refers to an alphanumeric or graphic one-way or two-way service that sends, receives and displays messages on a mobile device."
"39","Metadata","Metadata is information that describes various facets of an information asset to improve its usability throughout its life cycle. It is metadata that turns information into an asset.

Self-service analytics is often characterized by simple-to-use BI tools with basic analytic capabilities and an underlying data model that has been simplified or scaled down for ease of understanding and straightforward data access."
"48","Single Sign-On (SSO)","Single sign-on (SSO) provides the capability to authenticate once, and be subsequently and automatically authenticated when accessing various target systems. It eliminates the need to separately authenticate and sign on to individual applications and systems, essentially serving as a user surrogate between client workstations and target systems. Target applications and systems still maintain their own credential stores and present sign-on prompts to client devices. Behind the scenes, SSO responds to those prompts and maps the credentials to a single login/password pair. SSO is commonly deployed in enterprise, Web and federated models."
"49","SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)","A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-derived protocol governing network management and the monitoring of network devices. Strictly speaking, SNMP is the Management Information Base (MIB) described in the SNMP standard; extensions to this MIB proposed by the Electronic Messaging Association permit the monitoring and reporting of all conforming messaging components through standard SNMP management tools for network components."
"50","Solution Architecture","Architectures for specific projects or project releases, at a level of description appropriate for detailed design and implementation."
"51","synchronous","Having a constant time interval between successive bits, characters or events. Synchronous transmission uses no redundant information to identify the beginning and end of characters, and is faster and more efficient than asynchronous transmission, which uses start and stop bits. The timing is achieved by transmitting sync characters prior to data; usually synchronization can be achieved in two-or three-character times."
"52","System Integration","The process of creating a complex information system that may include designing or building a customized architecture or application, integrating it with new or existing hardware, packaged and custom software, and communications. Most enterprises rely on an external contractor for program management of most or all phases of system development. This external vendor generally also assumes a high degree of the project’s risks."
"53","Thin Client","Thin client is used to describe a type of client/server computing in which applications are run, and data is stored, on the server rather than on the client. Because the applications are executed on the server, they do not require client-resident installation, although the graphical user interface and some application logic may be rendered to the client.

A common misperception is that a thin-client application requires the use of a thin-client device (i.e., a stripped-down desktop machine that costs less to buy and maintain than a regular PC). However, while thin-client applications enable such devices to be used, they do not require it. In fact, more than 85% of devices used to display thin-client Windows applications are regular PCs, typically configured with both “fat-client” applications and access to thin-client ones."
"54","throughput","A computer term for the volume of work or information flowing through a system. Particularly meaningful in information storage and retrieval systems, in which throughput is measured in units such as accesses per hour."
"55","Unified Communications (UC)","Gartner defines unified communications (UC) products (equipment, software and services) as those that facilitate the interactive use of multiple enterprise communications methods. This can include control, management and integration of these methods. UC products integrate communications channels (media), networks and systems, as well as IT business applications and, in some cases, consumer applications and devices."
"56","user provisioning","User provisioning or account provisioning technology creates, modifies, disables and deletes user accounts and their profiles across IT infrastructure and business applications. Provisioning tools use approaches such as cloning, roles and business rules so businesses can automate onboarding, off-boarding and other administration workforce processes (for example, new hires, transfers, promotions and terminations). Provisioning tools also automatically aggregate and correlate identity data from HR, CRM, email systems and other “identity stores.” Fulfillment is initiated via self-service, management request or HR system changes. Regulatory compliance and security efficiencies continue to drive most user-provisioning implementations."
"57","Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)","Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is the practice of hosting a desktop operating system within a virtual machine (VM) running on a centralized server. VDI is a variation on the client/server computing model, sometimes referred to as server-based computing.

"58","Virtual LAN (VLAN)","A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a set of systems that, regardless of higher-layer addressing or location, is designated as a logical LAN and treated as a set of contiguous systems on a single LAN segment. Virtual LANs can be proprietary or standardized using the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1Q. Typical grouping parameters for VLANs include the port number of the hub, switch or router, the higher-layer protocol such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), the Media Access Control (MAC) address, and the traditional subnet. The goal of VLANs is to provide simpler administration, simple moves/adds/changes to network devices, and partitioning at the MAC layer."
"59","Visualization","Visualization is the illustration of information objects and their relationships on a display. Strategic visualization graphically illustrates the strength of relationships by the proximity of objects on the display. Advanced technology can make a significant difference in users’ ability to interface to large knowledge repositories. These advances use the distance between objects on the display to reflect the similarity of meaning, similarity of content or other relationships (e.g., association with a group)."
"60","Voice Response System (VRS)","Voice response systems (VRSs) are specialized technologies designed for providing callers with verbal and faxed answers to inquiries without assistance from a person.
